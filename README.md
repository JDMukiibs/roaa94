## Flutter Tutorials

Aside from regularely sharing Flutter tips on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/roaakdm), I usually publish articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@roaakdm) whenever I have the chance (and the ideas):
  
* [Flutter ScrollPhysics Variations & Use Cases](https://medium.com/@roaakdm/flutter-scrollphysics-variations-use-cases-da87528cc6c1)
  
The ‘physics’ widget param is found in all scrollable widgets (SingleChildScrollView, CustomScrollView, NestedScrollView, ListView, GridView, TabBarView, ListWheelScrollView …etc) In this article, I will go over the variation of ScrollPhysics that this param can take and what that variation does.
  
* [Create a Theme and Primary Color Switcher For Your Flutter App Using Provider](https://medium.com/flutter-community/create-a-theme-and-primary-color-switcher-for-your-flutter-app-using-provider-fd334dd7d761)

Learn how to create a functional theme switcher with the ability to change the primary color of your app using Provider. You will also learn how to change the primary color swatch and get MaterialColor from Color.

* [Flutter Image Uploader With App Permissions and Compression Using GetIt Services](https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-image-uploader-with-app-permissions-and-compression-using-getit-services-59ffea13f913)
  
Allow image upload in your Flutter app with one line of code in your widget while handling everything from camera & gallery permissions to image compression under the hood with GetIt and the service locator pattern.
  
* I also wrote some [tutorials for the Dashtronaut Slide Puzzle Game](https://dashtronaut.app/tutorials/introduction) that you can check out
